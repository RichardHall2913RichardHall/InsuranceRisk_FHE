# InsuranceRisk_FHE

A confidential FHE-powered platform for analyzing systemic risk in the insurance industry. Regulatory agencies can assess aggregated risk using encrypted data from multiple insurance companies while preserving the confidentiality of individual business data.

## Project Overview

Traditional insurance risk analysis faces challenges such as:

* Exposure of sensitive business information when sharing data across companies.
* Difficulty in performing cross-company aggregate computations without compromising confidentiality.
* Limited trust in centralized risk assessment processes.

InsuranceRisk_FHE mitigates these issues by:

* Using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to encrypt company risk data.
* Performing on-chain aggregation and risk analysis without revealing individual datasets.
* Providing regulators with secure, verifiable insights into systemic risk.

## Features

### Core Functionality

* **Encrypted Data Submission**: Insurance companies submit encrypted reinsurance and risk metrics.
* **FHE Aggregation**: Aggregate risk calculations are performed directly on encrypted data.
* **Confidential Reporting**: Regulators receive comprehensive insights without access to raw company data.
* **Real-Time Analysis**: Encrypted datasets can be processed continuously for up-to-date risk assessment.

### Privacy & Confidentiality

* **End-to-End Encryption**: All data encrypted before leaving company systems.
* **Immutable Records**: Data stored on-chain is tamper-proof and verifiable.
* **Encrypted Computation**: Aggregation and risk metrics computed without decrypting individual contributions.
* **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Ensures regulatory compliance while protecting commercial secrets.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

InsuranceRiskFHE.sol (deployed on Ethereum)

* **DataManager**: Handles submission of encrypted risk data.
* **Aggregator**: Performs encrypted risk calculations.
* **AuditTrail**: Maintains verifiable logs for regulatory review.

### Frontend Application

* **React + TypeScript**: Interactive UI for companies and regulators.
* **FHE Client Library**: Encrypts data locally and generates proofs.
* **Ethers.js**: Blockchain integration for submitting encrypted data and querying results.
* **Dashboard**: Displays encrypted aggregate metrics and trends.

## Technology Stack

### Blockchain

* Solidity ^0.8.24: Smart contract development
* OpenZeppelin: Secure contract libraries
* Hardhat: Development, testing, and deployment framework
* Ethereum Testnet: Current environment for deployment and testing

### Frontend

* React 18 + TypeScript: Modern and responsive UI
* Tailwind CSS: Styling and layout
* Ethers.js: Blockchain interaction
* FHE Libraries: Client-side encryption and verification

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+ environment
* npm / yarn / pnpm package manager
* Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Deploy smart contracts to a testnet.
4. Launch frontend with `npm start`.

## Usage

* **Submit Encrypted Data**: Insurance companies encrypt and submit risk metrics.
* **View Aggregated Risk**: Regulators analyze system-wide risk without accessing individual company data.
* **Filter & Drill-Down**: Explore sector-specific trends while maintaining data privacy.

## Security Features

* End-to-end encryption of risk data
* Immutable on-chain storage
* Homomorphic computation for secure aggregation
* Zero-knowledge proofs to validate results without revealing data

## Future Enhancements

* Expand to multi-jurisdictional risk analysis
* Integrate predictive modeling on encrypted datasets
* Support automated regulatory reporting with secure verification
* Enable real-time alerts for risk thresholds
* Mobile interface for encrypted submission and monitoring

Built with FHE to ensure privacy, security, and trustworthy evaluation of systemic insurance risk.
